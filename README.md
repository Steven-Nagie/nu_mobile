### Overview

nu.world is an environmentally conscious social media app. It's built around an environmental tool called a carbon calculator. Users input information about their lifestyles, such as how much they drive and how much water they use, and the calculator outputs the user's calculated carbon emissions.

Users can customize their profile, go through the calculator and see stats about their emissions, and push themselves to decrease their impact with some suggested challenges.
