psql -U postgres to sign in with postgres username

**Within the user-routes file, you'll have to modify the getUserScheme function to deal with more than just email or username or whatever

**The "friends" column in the users table is a text field. You will have to use JSON to convert it from an object to a string (stringify or parser, one of those two).

** SCHEMA **
CREATE TABLE users
(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  firstname TEXT,
  lastname TEXT,
  state VARCHAR(2),
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  password TEXT,
  friends TEXT
)
