Working on Profile styling. Currently for whatever reason, can't get the links on the bottom of the banner to show up. the entire view just disappears whenever I try to put it anywhere on the banner. Maybe a z-index issue?

Font sizes need to be about three times as large as they are on the mobile wireframes in order to look right due to the difference in logical and real pixel ratios.

This is how to send the token in order to get authorization.

ip at DevMountain: 192.168.0.79
ip at Home: 10.0.0.21
ip at Jarrell's: 192.168.1.188
droplet ip: 104.236.79.194

async _getProtectedQuote() {
var DEMO_TOKEN = await AsyncStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
console.log(DEMO_TOKEN);
fetch("http://104.236.79.194:3001/api/protected/random-quote", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + DEMO_TOKEN
  }
})
.then((response) => response.text())
.then((quote) => {
  Alert.alert(
    "Chuck Norris Quote:", quote,
    [{text: "Hate it", onPress: () => console.log("The user does not like this quote")},
    {text: 'Love it', onPress: () => console.log("The user likes this quote")}]
    );
})
.done();
}

<View style={[styles.bannerLinks, {width: width}]}>
  <Text style={{marginHorizontal: 10}}>Feed</Text>
  <Text style={{marginHorizontal: 10}}>Followers</Text>
  <Text style={{marginHorizontal: 10}}>Following</Text>
</View>

Hacky logout:
