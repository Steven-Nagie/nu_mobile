This is how to send the token in order to get authorization.

async _getProtectedQuote() {
var DEMO_TOKEN = await AsyncStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
console.log(DEMO_TOKEN);
fetch("http://192.168.0.79:3001/api/protected/random-quote", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + DEMO_TOKEN
  }
})
.then((response) => response.text())
.then((quote) => {
  Alert.alert(
    "Chuck Norris Quote:", quote,
    [{text: "Hate it", onPress: () => console.log("The user does not like this quote")},
    {text: 'Love it', onPress: () => console.log("The user likes this quote")}]
    );
})
.done();
}

When user puts in state, you will have to make sure to push it to all uppercase. Do we want to capitalize the first letter of everyone's first and last name or simply leave it like they give it to us?
